# ComicCacher

> Serving up daily laughs since 2013

A personal project to read my favorite daily comic strips without ads, pop-ups, or paywalls. Just comics.

Originally written in C# and .NET 3.0 back in 2013, this has been rebuilt from the ground up with modern tech:
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3 + Java 21 API that downloads and caches comics daily
- **Frontend**: Angular 19 + Material Design web app with glassmorphism UI
- **Hosting**: Runs in my home K8s cluster

There's no public deployment - I built this for my own use and for fun. But if you'd like to run it yourself, go ahead!

## What does it do?

- ðŸ“° Downloads daily comic strips from GoComics and ComicsKingdom
- ðŸ’¾ Caches images locally with automatic 7-day cleanup
- ðŸŽ¨ Displays them in a clean, ad-free interface
- ðŸ“± Works great on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- âš¡ Virtual scrolling for smooth browsing
- ðŸ“Š Tracks metrics on cache performance and storage
