# Angular Test Coverage Improvements

## Enhanced Test Coverage

1. **ComicService Tests**
   - Added tests for all service methods:
     - `getEarliest`: Tests retrieving the earliest comic strip
     - `getNext`: Tests getting the next comic by date
     - `getPrev`: Tests getting the previous comic by date
     - `getAvatar`: Tests retrieving comic avatars
     - `getComics`: Tests the comics signal observable
     - `refresh`: Tests comic data refreshing

2. **ComicpageComponent Tests**
   - Added tests for component interactions:
     - Event handling between container and parent component
     - Navbar visibility toggle based on scroll events
     - Data flow from service to component to child components
     - Proper initialization and data binding

3. **Added Integration Testing Foundation**
   - Created an integration test file structure to test components working together
   - Tests for component hierarchy interactions
   - Tests for event propagation between components

## Test Quality Improvements

1. **Better Mock Objects**
   - Using proper EventEmitter in mock components
   - Input/Output decorated properties
   - Properly typed mock objects

2. **Component Interaction Testing**
   - Testing output events from child to parent
   - Testing input property binding
   - Testing event propagation

3. **Service Method Testing**
   - Complete coverage of all service methods
   - Testing error handling
   - Testing empty/null value handling

## Outstanding Issues

There are still some failing tests that need to be addressed:

1. Issues with the ScrollDispatcher in ContainerComponent tests
2. Some mock components need better implementation
3. Some component tests need to be updated to match latest implementation

## Next Steps

1. Fix remaining test failures one by one
2. Add complete integration tests testing multiple components working together
3. Add end-to-end tests for complete user flows
4. Add accessibility testing
